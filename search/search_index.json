In UN ECOSOC consultative arrangements, an organization \u201cnot established by a governmental entity or intergovernmental agreement\u201d is considered a non-governmental organization for the purpose of those arrangements. ( ECOSOC Resolution 1996/31 (PDF\u2014UN DESA) ) [web:63] ECOSOC also specifies governance-related expectations for NGOs seeking consultative status (e.g., representative structure and accountability mechanisms to members). ( ECOSOC Resolution 1996/31 (PDF\u2014UN DESA) ) [web:63] Working definition for this lecture (synthesis): An NGO is a non-state, non-profit (or not-for-profit) organization, institutionally independent of government creation, that undertakes social, humanitarian, development, rights, or environmental work and may engage with public systems through coordination or consultative mechanisms. ( ECOSOC Resolution 1996/31 (PDF\u2014UN DESA) ) [web:63] 1.2 What is a \u201cdisaster\u201d (India legal definition)? Under India\u2019s Disaster Management Act, 2005, \u201cdisaster\u201d means a catastrophe/mishap/calamity/grave occurrence arising from natural or man-made causes (or accident/negligence) that results in substantial loss of life/suffering/property damage/environmental degradation and is beyond the coping capacity of the affected community. ( Disaster Management Act, 2005 (PDF\u2014NDM India) ) [web:74] 1.3 What is \u201cdisaster management\u201d (India legal definition)? The DM Act defines \u201cdisaster management\u201d as a continuous and integrated process of planning, organizing, coordinating, and implementing measures for prevention, mitigation, capacity-building, preparedness, prompt response, assessment, evacuation/rescue/relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction. ( Disaster Management Act, 2005 (PDF\u2014NDM India) ) [web:74] 1.4 Core DRR terminology (international standard) Hazard: A process, phenomenon, or human activity that may cause loss of life/injury/health impacts, property damage, social/economic disruption, or environmental degradation. ( UNDRR terminology\u2014Hazard ) [web:86] Disaster risk: The potential loss of life, injury, or destroyed/damaged assets that could occur in a period of time, probabilistically as a function of hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and capacity. ( UNDRR terminology\u2014Disaster risk ) [web:88] Disaster risk reduction (DRR): Aimed at preventing new and reducing existing disaster risk and managing residual risk, strengthening resilience and supporting sustainable development. ( UNDRR terminology\u2014DRR ) [web:75] Resilience: The ability of a system/community/society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate, adapt to, transform, and recover from hazard effects in a timely and efficient manner, including preserving/restoring essential structures/functions through risk management. ( UNDRR terminology\u2014Resilience ) [web:78] 1.5 International policy frame: Sendai The Sendai Framework (2015\u20132030) is the global DRR framework and calls for engaging relevant stakeholders (including community practitioners, volunteers, and vulnerable groups) in DRR design and implementation. ( Sendai Framework (PDF on PreventionWeb) ) [web:13] A UNDRR explainer page can be cited in short lecture notes and policy introductions. ( UNDRR\u2014What is the Sendai Framework? ) [web:10] 2) Why NGOs are central in disaster management 2.1 Complementarity with the state India\u2019s legal framing makes disaster management an integrated, continuous process requiring planning, coordination, and implementation across prevention-to-reconstruction, which creates a space for specialized and community-linked actors to supplement government capacity. ( Disaster Management Act, 2005 (PDF\u2014NDM India) ) [web:74] NDMA\u2019s dedicated guideline on the \u201cRole of NGOs\u201d provides an official basis to treat NGOs as structured partners (not ad-hoc actors) across preparedness, response, and recovery, including coordination expectations. ( NDMA\u2014Role of NGOs Guideline (PDF) ) [web:3] 2.2 CBDRR lens (community-first) NDMA\u2019s CBDRR Guidelines explicitly frame CSOs/NGOs and CBOs, alongside PRIs, as key actors in transforming communities toward self-reliance in dealing with disasters. ( NDMA\u2014CBDRR Guidelines Oct 2024 (PDF) ) [web:28] 2.3 Governance and legitimacy (UN perspective) ECOSOC consultative arrangements emphasize that NGOs should have representative structures and accountability mechanisms, which is relevant when discussing NGO legitimacy in disaster governance. ( ECOSOC Resolution 1996/31 (PDF\u2014UN DESA) ) [web:63] 3) Official & international policy anchors (where NGO roles are defined) India (official) NDMA\u2019s guideline explicitly focuses on NGO roles across the disaster management cycle and GO\u2013NGO coordination mechanisms. ( NDMA Guideline\u2014Role of NGOs in Disaster Management (PDF) ) [web:3] The CBDRR Guidelines (2024) frame NGOs/CSOs and CBOs as essential actors alongside PRIs for building self-reliant communities. ( NDMA\u2014CBDRR Guidelines Oct 2024 (PDF) ) [web:28] Odisha (official) OSDMA maintains a GO\u2013NGO coordination focus and highlights NGOs\u2019 grassroots presence and community linkages in disaster contexts. ( OSDMA\u2014GO\u2013NGO Coordination ) [web:5] OSDMA also provides an official NGO registration interface for coordination and information capture (operational areas, prior disaster work, contacts). ( OSDMA\u2014NGO Registration ) [web:32] International (official) The Sendai Framework stresses that governments should engage relevant stakeholders (including community practitioners, volunteers, vulnerable groups) across DRR priorities. ( Sendai Framework (PDF on PreventionWeb) ) [web:13] A concise UNDRR explainer is also available for policy framing in academic writing. ( UNDRR\u2014What is the Sendai Framework? ) [web:10] 4) Statistics you can cite (India + Odisha) India: hazard exposure (official synthesis) India\u2019s national Sendai Midterm Review report compiles headline exposure indicators (e.g., large shares of land/coastline exposed to earthquakes, floods, cyclones/tsunami risks, and drought vulnerability). ( NDMA\u2014India Sendai Framework Midterm Review (VNR) (PDF) ) [web:51] Use the NDMA VNR as your \u201cofficial umbrella source\u201d for nationally reported vulnerability statistics in academic writing, and cite the relevant page/section after you verify the exact line you are quoting. ( NDMA\u2014India Sendai Framework Midterm Review (VNR) (PDF) ) [web:51] Odisha: evidence of risk-reduction outcomes (official + academic) Odisha\u2019s preparedness improvements (institutional strengthening and evacuation/shelter systems) are highlighted by the World Bank as globally instructive. ( World Bank\u2014Odisha\u2019s turnaround ) [web:46] Cyclone Phailin (2013) is documented with emphasis on coordinated response and volunteer mobilization linked to DRM programming. ( UNDP\u2014Phailin response assessment (PDF) ) [web:20] For an academic narrative on Phailin and Odisha preparedness, see the dedicated case study paper. ( UKSCIP paper\u2014Phailin cyclone case study (PDF) ) [web:16] 5) NGO roles across the Disaster Management Cycle (what to teach + how to write it) NDMA\u2019s NGO guideline frames NGO contributions across preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery , including community awareness, training, relief logistics, and longer-term rehabilitation. ( NDMA Guideline\u2014Role of NGOs (PDF) ) [web:3] The CBDRR Guidelines emphasize community-centered methods where NGOs/CSOs help enable risk understanding, inclusive planning, local institutions (committees/volunteers), and continuity between DRR and development. ( NDMA\u2014CBDRR Guidelines Oct 2024 (PDF) ) [web:28] 5.1 Preparedness (typical NGO functions) Community organization and volunteer training, mock drills, awareness/IEC, school/community preparedness support. ( NDMA\u2014CBDRR Guidelines Oct 2024 (PDF) ) [web:28] Risk communication and community media approaches are studied in Odisha (e.g., community radio and disaster communication). ( SAGE\u2014Community radio & disaster communication in Odisha (2025) ) [web:2] 5.2 Mitigation and DRR mainstreaming Participatory risk assessment and mainstreaming DRR in local development planning (CBDRR framing). ( NDMA\u2014CBDRR Guidelines Oct 2024 (PDF) ) [web:28] Integration with national/state planning is also tied to government\u2013UNDP program approaches for institutional/community resilience. ( MHA/NDM India\u2014GoI\u2013UNDP Projects ) [web:6] 5.3 Response (relief + coordination) Rapid needs assessment, relief distribution (WASH/food/shelter), protection of vulnerable groups, and coordination with government systems. ( NDMA Guideline\u2014Role of NGOs (PDF) ) [web:3] For Phailin, UNDP\u2019s review documents volunteer mobilization and DRM-linked community engagement during response. ( UNDP\u2014Phailin assessment (PDF) ) [web:20] 5.4 Recovery and reconstruction \u201cBuild back better\u201d support, livelihood restoration, psychosocial support, and strengthening local institutions to reduce future risk. ( NDMA Guideline\u2014Role of NGOs (PDF) ) [web:3] 6) Odisha focus: coordination mechanisms + selected NGOs/actors (official entry points + primary sources) 6.1 GO\u2013NGO coordination (official mechanisms) OSDMA maintains GO\u2013NGO coordination information, including an official registration interface to help coordinate disaster-related NGO activities. ( OSDMA\u2014GO\u2013NGO Coordination ) [web:5] ( OSDMA\u2014NGO Registration ) [web:32] Teaching point: In academic writing, treat this as the official coordination gateway for Odisha, and then document individual NGOs using their official portfolios and credible evaluations. ( OSDMA\u2014NGO Registration ) [web:32] 6.2 Odisha networks / examples ODMP (Odisha Development Management Programme) is a state-level NGO network established after the 1999 cyclone (official site).

( UKSCIP paper\u2014Phailin cyclone case study (PDF) ) [web:16] 6.4 Case-based teaching: Cyclone Fani (2019) and NGO response reporting ActionAid\u2019s official response reporting can be used as a primary source for describing NGO relief actions and targeted support components. ( ActionAid\u2014Disaster responses across India (incl. 2019) ) [web:21] 7) NGO landscape lists (Odisha, India, international) Note: Official sources do not always publish a single \u201ccomplete roster\u201d of all NGOs working on disasters; the most defensible academic approach is (a) cite official coordination/registration mechanisms, and (b) list NGOs with their official websites and documented disaster portfolios (non-exhaustive). ( OSDMA\u2014NGO Registration ) [web:32] 7.1 Odisha-focused (networks + institutional channels) OSDMA NGO registration/coordination channel (official mechanism) \u2014 use this as your \u201cofficial entry point\u201d for Odisha GO\u2013NGO coordination.
