Assertion and Reason Directions: For the following questions, two statements are given-one labeled Assertion (A) and the other labeled Reason (R). Select the correct answer to these questions from the codes (a), (b), (c) and (d) as given below: a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A. b) Both A and R are true but R is NOT the correct explanation of A. c) A is true but R is false. d) A is false but R is true. Assertion (A): NGOs play a critical complementary role to the government in disaster management. Reason (R): Government machinery may sometimes need specialized support, community linkages, and additional manpower which NGOs can provide effectively. View Answer Answer: (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A. Explanation: The assertion is true because governments cannot do everything alone. The reason correctly explains *why* NGOs are complementary: they fill specific gaps like grassroots reach and specialized skills that the government might lack in a crisis. Assertion (A): The Sendai Framework calls for an all-of-society engagement in disaster risk reduction. Reason (R): Disaster risk reduction is solely the responsibility of the central government. View Answer Answer: (c) A is true but R is false. Explanation: The assertion is true as Sendai emphasizes shared responsibility. The reason is false because DRR is a shared responsibility involving states, local bodies, private sector, NGOs, and communities, not just the central government. VI.

Explain the roles of NGOs across the disaster management cycle using India\u2019s national guidance and CBDRR framing. Describe Odisha\u2019s institutional approach to GO\u2013NGO coordination and why it is globally cited as a resilience \u201cturnaround\u201d case. 1) Definitions 1.1 What is an NGO? In UN ECOSOC consultative arrangements, an organization \u201cnot established by a governmental entity or intergovernmental agreement\u201d is considered a non-governmental organization. Working definition: An NGO is a non-state, non-profit organization, institutionally independent of government creation, that undertakes social, humanitarian, development, rights, or environmental work. 1.2 What is a \u201cdisaster\u201d? Under India\u2019s Disaster Management Act, 2005 , \u201cdisaster\u201d means a catastrophe, mishap, calamity, or grave occurrence arising from natural or man-made causes that results in substantial loss of life or property and is beyond the coping capacity of the affected community . 1.3 What is \u201cdisaster management\u201d? The DM Act defines it as a continuous and integrated process of planning, organizing, coordinating, and implementing measures for prevention, mitigation, capacity-building, preparedness, prompt response, assessment, evacuation, rescue, relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction. 1.4 Core DRR Terminology (UNDRR) Hazard: A process, phenomenon, or human activity that may cause loss of life, injury, or other health impacts. Disaster Risk: Potential loss of life, injury, or destroyed assets (function of hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and capacity). Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR): Aimed at preventing new and reducing existing disaster risk. Resilience: The ability of a system/community exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate, adapt to, transform, and recover. 1.5 International policy frame: Sendai The Sendai Framework (2015\u20132030) is the global DRR framework and calls for engaging relevant stakeholders (including community practitioners, volunteers, and vulnerable groups) in DRR design and implementation. ( Sendai Framework (PDF on PreventionWeb) ) [web:13] A UNDRR explainer page can be cited in short lecture notes and policy introductions. ( UNDRR\u2014What is the Sendai Framework? ) [web:10] 2) Why NGOs are Central in Disaster Management 2.1 Complementarity with the State Integrated Process: The law frames disaster management as continuous (prevention-to-reconstruction), creating space for specialized actors. Structured Partners: NDMA guidelines treat NGOs as structured partners in preparedness, response, and recovery, not just ad-hoc helpers. 2.2 CBDRR Lens (Community-First) Local Transformation: Guidelines explicitly frame NGOs and CSOs as key to transforming communities toward self-reliance. 2.3 Governance and Legitimacy Accountability: NGOs are expected to have representative structures and accountability, crucial for legitimacy in governance. 3) Official & international policy anchors (where NGO roles are defined) India (official) NDMA\u2019s guideline explicitly focuses on NGO roles across the disaster management cycle and GO\u2013NGO coordination mechanisms. ( NDMA Guideline\u2014Role of NGOs in Disaster Management (PDF) ) [web:3] The CBDRR Guidelines (2024) frame NGOs/CSOs and CBOs as essential actors alongside PRIs for building self-reliant communities.

( UNDRR\u2014What is the Sendai Framework? ) [web:10] 4) Statistics (India + Odisha) India: hazard exposure (official synthesis) India\u2019s national Sendai Midterm Review report compiles headline exposure indicators (e.g., large shares of land/coastline exposed to earthquakes, floods, cyclones/tsunami risks, and drought vulnerability). ( NDMA\u2014India Sendai Framework Midterm Review (VNR) (PDF) ) [web:51] Use the NDMA VNR as your \u201cofficial umbrella source\u201d for nationally reported vulnerability statistics in academic writing, and cite the relevant page/section after you verify the exact line you are quoting.

( UKSCIP paper\u2014Phailin cyclone case study (PDF) ) [web:16] 5) NGO roles across the Disaster Management Cycle NDMA\u2019s NGO guideline frames NGO contributions across preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery , including community awareness, training, relief logistics, and longer-term rehabilitation. ( NDMA Guideline\u2014Role of NGOs (PDF) ) [web:3] The CBDRR Guidelines emphasize community-centered methods where NGOs/CSOs help enable risk understanding, inclusive planning, local institutions (committees/volunteers), and continuity between DRR and development. ( NDMA\u2014CBDRR Guidelines Oct 2024 (PDF) ) [web:28] 5.1 Preparedness (typical NGO functions) Community organization and volunteer training, mock drills, awareness/IEC, school/community preparedness support. ( NDMA\u2014CBDRR Guidelines Oct 2024 (PDF) ) [web:28] Risk communication and community media approaches are studied in Odisha (e.g., community radio and disaster communication).

Teaching Point In academic writing, treat OSDMA as the official coordination gateway for Odisha. Document individual NGOs using their official portfolios and credible evaluations. 6.2 Odisha Networks / Examples ODMP (Odisha Development Management Programme): A state-level NGO network established after the 1999 cyclone. Odisha Red Cross: The official state-level interface to the Indian Red Cross Society. 6.3 Case-Based Teaching: Cyclone Phailin (2013) UNDP\u2019s assessment provides an official evaluation-style document you can cite for community mobilization and volunteer contributions . 6.4 Case-Based Teaching: Cyclone Fani (2019) ActionAid\u2019s official response reporting can be used as a primary source for describing NGO relief actions. 7) NGO landscape lists (Odisha, India, international) Note: Official sources do not always publish a single \u201ccomplete roster\u201d of all NGOs working on disasters; the most defensible academic approach is (a) cite official coordination/registration mechanisms, and (b) list NGOs with their official websites and documented disaster portfolios (non-exhaustive).

Assertion (A): NGOs play a critical complementary role to the government in disaster management. Reason (R): Government machinery may sometimes need specialized support, community linkages, and additional manpower which NGOs can provide effectively. View Answer Answer: (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A. Explanation: The assertion is true because governments cannot do everything alone. The reason correctly explains *why* NGOs are complementary: they fill specific gaps like grassroots reach and specialized skills that the government might lack in a crisis. Assertion (A): The Sendai Framework calls for an all-of-society engagement in disaster risk reduction. Reason (R): Disaster risk reduction is solely the responsibility of the central government. View Answer Answer: (c) A is true but R is false. Explanation: The assertion is true as Sendai emphasizes shared responsibility. The reason is false because DRR is a shared responsibility involving states, local bodies, private sector, NGOs, and communities, not just the central government.","title":"V.
