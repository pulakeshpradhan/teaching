## 1) Definitions

### 1.1 What is an NGO?

In UN ECOSOC(United Nations Economic and Social Council) consultative arrangements, an organization “not established by a governmental entity or intergovernmental agreement” is considered a non-governmental organization for the purpose of those arrangements. ([ECOSOC Resolution 1996/31 (PDF—UN DESA)](https://social.desa.un.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/resolution-1996-31.pdf)) [web:63]  

ECOSOC also specifies governance-related expectations for NGOs seeking consultative status (e.g., representative structure and accountability mechanisms to members). ([ECOSOC Resolution 1996/31 (PDF—UN DESA)](https://social.desa.un.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/resolution-1996-31.pdf)) [web:63]  

**Working definition:** An NGO is a non-state, non-profit (or not-for-profit) organization, institutionally independent of government creation, that undertakes social, humanitarian, development, rights, or environmental work and may engage with public systems through coordination or consultative mechanisms. ([ECOSOC Resolution 1996/31 (PDF—UN DESA)](https://social.desa.un.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/resolution-1996-31.pdf)) [web:63]  

### 1.2 What is a “disaster” (India legal definition)?

Under India’s Disaster Management Act, 2005, “disaster” means a catastrophe/mishap/calamity/grave occurrence arising from natural or man-made causes (or accident/negligence) that results in substantial loss of life/suffering/property damage/environmental degradation and is beyond the coping capacity of the affected community. ([Disaster Management Act, 2005 (PDF—NDM India)](https://ndmindia.mha.gov.in/ndmi/images/The%20Disaster%20Management%20Act,%202005.pdf)) [web:74]  

### 1.3 What is “disaster management” (India legal definition)?

The DM Act defines “disaster management” as a continuous and integrated process of planning, organizing, coordinating, and implementing measures for prevention, mitigation, capacity-building, preparedness, prompt response, assessment, evacuation/rescue/relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction. ([Disaster Management Act, 2005 (PDF—NDM India)](https://ndmindia.mha.gov.in/ndmi/images/The%20Disaster%20Management%20Act,%202005.pdf)) [web:74]  

### 1.4 Core DRR terminology (international standard)

**Hazard:** A process, phenomenon, or human activity that may cause loss of life/injury/health impacts, property damage, social/economic disruption, or environmental degradation. ([UNDRR terminology—Hazard](https://www.undrr.org/terminology/hazard)) [web:86]  

**Disaster risk:** The potential loss of life, injury, or destroyed/damaged assets that could occur in a period of time, probabilistically as a function of hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and capacity. ([UNDRR terminology—Disaster risk](https://www.undrr.org/terminology/disaster-risk)) [web:88]  

**Disaster risk reduction (DRR):** Aimed at preventing new and reducing existing disaster risk and managing residual risk, strengthening resilience and supporting sustainable development. ([UNDRR terminology—DRR](https://www.undrr.org/terminology/disaster-risk-reduction)) [web:75]  

**Resilience:** The ability of a system/community/society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate, adapt to, transform, and recover from hazard effects in a timely and efficient manner, including preserving/restoring essential structures/functions through risk management. ([UNDRR terminology—Resilience](https://www.undrr.org/terminology/resilience)) [web:78]  

### 1.5 International policy frame: Sendai

The Sendai Framework (2015–2030) is the global DRR framework and calls for engaging relevant stakeholders (including community practitioners, volunteers, and vulnerable groups) in DRR design and implementation. ([Sendai Framework (PDF on PreventionWeb)](https://www.preventionweb.net/files/43291_sendaiframeworkfordrren.pdf)) [web:13]  

A UNDRR explainer page can be cited in short lecture notes and policy introductions. ([UNDRR—What is the Sendai Framework?](https://www.undrr.org/implementing-sendai-framework/what-sendai-framework)) [web:10]

## 2) Why NGOs are central in disaster management

### 2.1 Complementarity with the state

India’s legal framing makes disaster management an integrated, continuous process requiring planning, coordination, and implementation across prevention-to-reconstruction, which creates a space for specialized and community-linked actors to supplement government capacity. ([Disaster Management Act, 2005 (PDF—NDM India)](https://ndmindia.mha.gov.in/ndmi/images/The%20Disaster%20Management%20Act,%202005.pdf)) [web:74]  

NDMA’s dedicated guideline on the “Role of NGOs” provides an official basis to treat NGOs as structured partners (not ad-hoc actors) across preparedness, response, and recovery, including coordination expectations. ([NDMA—Role of NGOs Guideline (PDF)](https://www.ddmakangra.org/public/ngo_corner/showimg%20(1).pdf)) [web:3]  

### 2.2 CBDRR lens (community-first)

NDMA’s CBDRR Guidelines explicitly frame CSOs/NGOs and CBOs, alongside PRIs, as key actors in transforming communities toward self-reliance in dealing with disasters. ([NDMA—CBDRR Guidelines Oct 2024 (PDF)](https://ndma.gov.in/sites/default/files/PDF/Guidelines/CBDRR_Guidelines_Oct_2024.pdf)) [web:28]  

### 2.3 Governance and legitimacy (UN perspective)

ECOSOC consultative arrangements emphasize that NGOs should have representative structures and accountability mechanisms, which is relevant when discussing NGO legitimacy in disaster governance. ([ECOSOC Resolution 1996/31 (PDF—UN DESA)](https://social.desa.un.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/resolution-1996-31.pdf)) [web:63]  

---

## 3) Official & international policy anchors (where NGO roles are defined)

### India (official)

NDMA’s guideline **explicitly focuses on NGO roles** across the disaster management cycle and GO–NGO coordination mechanisms. ([NDMA Guideline—Role of NGOs in Disaster Management (PDF)](https://www.ddmakangra.org/public/ngo_corner/showimg%20(1).pdf)) [web:3]  

The **CBDRR Guidelines (2024)** frame NGOs/CSOs and CBOs as essential actors alongside PRIs for building self-reliant communities. ([NDMA—CBDRR Guidelines Oct 2024 (PDF)](https://ndma.gov.in/sites/default/files/PDF/Guidelines/CBDRR_Guidelines_Oct_2024.pdf)) [web:28]  

### Odisha (official)

OSDMA maintains a GO–NGO coordination focus and highlights NGOs’ grassroots presence and community linkages in disaster contexts. ([OSDMA—GO–NGO Coordination](https://www.osdma.org/capacity-building/go-ngo-coordination/)) [web:5]  

OSDMA also provides an official NGO registration interface for coordination and information capture (operational areas, prior disaster work, contacts). ([OSDMA—NGO Registration](https://www.osdma.org/ngo-registration/)) [web:32]  

### International (official)

The Sendai Framework stresses that governments should engage relevant stakeholders (including community practitioners, volunteers, vulnerable groups) across DRR priorities. ([Sendai Framework (PDF on PreventionWeb)](https://www.preventionweb.net/files/43291_sendaiframeworkfordrren.pdf)) [web:13]  
A concise UNDRR explainer is also available for policy framing in academic writing. ([UNDRR—What is the Sendai Framework?](https://www.undrr.org/implementing-sendai-framework/what-sendai-framework)) [web:10]  

---

## 4) Statistics (India + Odisha)

### India: hazard exposure (official synthesis)

India’s national Sendai Midterm Review report compiles headline exposure indicators (e.g., large shares of land/coastline exposed to earthquakes, floods, cyclones/tsunami risks, and drought vulnerability). ([NDMA—India Sendai Framework Midterm Review (VNR) (PDF)](https://ndma.gov.in/sites/default/files/PDF/India-SFDRR-Midterm-Review-Report.pdf)) [web:51]  

Use the NDMA VNR as your “official umbrella source” for nationally reported vulnerability statistics in academic writing, and cite the relevant page/section after you verify the exact line you are quoting. ([NDMA—India Sendai Framework Midterm Review (VNR) (PDF)](https://ndma.gov.in/sites/default/files/PDF/India-SFDRR-Midterm-Review-Report.pdf)) [web:51]  

### Odisha: evidence of risk-reduction outcomes

Odisha’s preparedness improvements (institutional strengthening and evacuation/shelter systems) are highlighted by the World Bank as globally instructive. ([World Bank—Odisha’s turnaround](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/opinion/2023/11/03/odisha-s-turnaround-in-disaster-management-has-lessons-for-the-world)) [web:46]  

Cyclone Phailin (2013) is documented with emphasis on coordinated response and volunteer mobilization linked to DRM programming. ([UNDP—Phailin response assessment (PDF)](https://ndmindia.mha.gov.in/ndmi/images/pdf/PhailinReport-UNDP-Odisha.pdf)) [web:20]  

For an academic narrative on Phailin and Odisha preparedness, see the dedicated case study paper. ([UKSCIP paper—Phailin cyclone case study (PDF)](https://ojs.ukscip.com/index.php/ptnd/article/download/1133/970/7953)) [web:16]  

---

## 5) NGO roles across the Disaster Management Cycle

NDMA’s NGO guideline frames NGO contributions across **preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery**, including community awareness, training, relief logistics, and longer-term rehabilitation. ([NDMA Guideline—Role of NGOs (PDF)](https://www.ddmakangra.org/public/ngo_corner/showimg%20(1).pdf)) [web:3]  

The CBDRR Guidelines emphasize community-centered methods where NGOs/CSOs help enable risk understanding, inclusive planning, local institutions (committees/volunteers), and continuity between DRR and development. ([NDMA—CBDRR Guidelines Oct 2024 (PDF)](https://ndma.gov.in/sites/default/files/PDF/Guidelines/CBDRR_Guidelines_Oct_2024.pdf)) [web:28]  

### 5.1 Preparedness (typical NGO functions)

- Community organization and volunteer training, mock drills, awareness/IEC, school/community preparedness support. ([NDMA—CBDRR Guidelines Oct 2024 (PDF)](https://ndma.gov.in/sites/default/files/PDF/Guidelines/CBDRR_Guidelines_Oct_2024.pdf)) [web:28]  
- Risk communication and community media approaches are studied in Odisha (e.g., community radio and disaster communication). ([SAGE—Community radio & disaster communication in Odisha (2025)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01634437241282243)) [web:2]  

### 5.2 Mitigation and DRR mainstreaming

- Participatory risk assessment and mainstreaming DRR in local development planning (CBDRR framing). ([NDMA—CBDRR Guidelines Oct 2024 (PDF)](https://ndma.gov.in/sites/default/files/PDF/Guidelines/CBDRR_Guidelines_Oct_2024.pdf)) [web:28]  
- Integration with national/state planning is also tied to government–UNDP program approaches for institutional/community resilience. ([MHA/NDM India—GoI–UNDP Projects](https://ndmindia.mha.gov.in/ndmi/goi-undp-projects)) [web:6]  

### 5.3 Response (relief + coordination)

- Rapid needs assessment, relief distribution (WASH/food/shelter), protection of vulnerable groups, and coordination with government systems. ([NDMA Guideline—Role of NGOs (PDF)](https://www.ddmakangra.org/public/ngo_corner/showimg%20(1).pdf)) [web:3]  
- For Phailin, UNDP’s review documents volunteer mobilization and DRM-linked community engagement during response. ([UNDP—Phailin assessment (PDF)](https://ndmindia.mha.gov.in/ndmi/images/pdf/PhailinReport-UNDP-Odisha.pdf)) [web:20]  

### 5.4 Recovery and reconstruction

- “Build back better” support, livelihood restoration, psychosocial support, and strengthening local institutions to reduce future risk. ([NDMA Guideline—Role of NGOs (PDF)](https://www.ddmakangra.org/public/ngo_corner/showimg%20(1).pdf)) [web:3]  

---

## 6) Odisha focus

### 6.1 GO–NGO coordination (official mechanisms)

OSDMA maintains GO–NGO coordination information, including an official registration interface to help coordinate disaster-related NGO activities. ([OSDMA—GO–NGO Coordination](https://www.osdma.org/capacity-building/go-ngo-coordination/)) [web:5] ([OSDMA—NGO Registration](https://www.osdma.org/ngo-registration/)) [web:32]  

**Teaching point:** In academic writing, treat this as the *official coordination gateway* for Odisha, and then document individual NGOs using their official portfolios and credible evaluations. ([OSDMA—NGO Registration](https://www.osdma.org/ngo-registration/)) [web:32]  

### 6.2 Odisha networks / examples

- **ODMP (Odisha Development Management Programme)** is a state-level NGO network established after the 1999 cyclone (official site). ([ODMP—Official website](https://odmp.in)) [web:33]  
- **Odisha Red Cross** provides official state-level interface to the Indian Red Cross Society’s work. ([Odisha Red Cross](https://odisharedcross.org)) [web:42]  

### 6.3 Case-based teaching: Cyclone Phailin (2013)

UNDP’s assessment provides an official evaluation-style document you can cite for community mobilization/volunteer contributions during Phailin response. ([UNDP—Phailin assessment (PDF)](https://ndmindia.mha.gov.in/ndmi/images/pdf/PhailinReport-UNDP-Odisha.pdf)) [web:20]  

A journal-style case study paper can be used to illustrate preparedness measures and institutional learning in Odisha. ([UKSCIP paper—Phailin cyclone case study (PDF)](https://ojs.ukscip.com/index.php/ptnd/article/download/1133/970/7953)) [web:16]  

### 6.4 Case-based teaching: Cyclone Fani (2019) and NGO response reporting

ActionAid’s official response reporting can be used as a primary source for describing NGO relief actions and targeted support components. ([ActionAid—Disaster responses across India (incl. 2019)](https://www.actionaidindia.org/emergency/response-to-disasters-across-india-2019/)) [web:21]  

---

## 7) NGO landscape lists (Odisha, India, international)

**Note:** Official sources do not always publish a single “complete roster” of all NGOs working on disasters; the most defensible academic approach is (a) cite official coordination/registration mechanisms, and (b) list NGOs with their official websites and documented disaster portfolios (non-exhaustive). ([OSDMA—NGO Registration](https://www.osdma.org/ngo-registration/)) [web:32]  

### 7.1 Odisha-focused (networks + institutional channels)

- **OSDMA NGO registration/coordination channel (official mechanism)** — use this as your “official entry point” for Odisha GO–NGO coordination. ([OSDMA—NGO Registration](https://www.osdma.org/ngo-registration/)) [web:32]  
- **OSDMA GO–NGO coordination page (official)** — cite when describing coordination intent and NGO role recognition. ([OSDMA—GO–NGO Coordination](https://www.osdma.org/capacity-building/go-ngo-coordination/)) [web:5]  
- **Odisha Development Management Programme (ODMP)** — Odisha NGO network established post-1999 cyclone (official site). ([ODMP—Official website](https://odmp.in)) [web:33]  
- **Indian Red Cross Society, Odisha (Bhubaneswar/state interface)** — official Odisha Red Cross site. ([Odisha Red Cross](https://odisharedcross.org)) [web:42]  

### 7.2 India-wide NGOs (primary/official sites)

- **Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS)** — national society and official website. ([IRCS—Official](https://www.indianredcross.org)) [web:41]  
- **Rapid Response** — official site with response portfolio overview. ([Rapid Response—Official](http://www.rapidresponse.org.in)) [web:35]  
- **CARE India** — official site. ([CARE India—Official](https://www.careindia.org)) [web:36]

## 9) Example

NGOs are formally recognized in India’s disaster governance as agencies that supplement government capacity across preparedness, response, and recovery, and NDMA provides detailed guidance on operational roles and coordination expectations. ([NDMA Guideline—Role of NGOs (PDF)](https://www.ddmakangra.org/public/ngo_corner/showimg%20(1).pdf)) [web:3]  
In Odisha, institutional investments and structured coordination are widely cited as central to the state’s improved cyclone outcomes, with external assessments framing Odisha’s approach as globally instructive for disaster resilience-building. ([World Bank—Odisha turnaround](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/opinion/2023/11/03/odisha-s-turnaround-in-disaster-management-has-lessons-for-the-world)) [web:46]  
Community-centered DRR approaches further position NGOs/CSOs and CBOs as core actors in enabling local risk understanding, inclusive planning, and preparedness capacity, as codified in India’s CBDRR Guidelines. ([NDMA—CBDRR Guidelines Oct 2024 (PDF)](https://ndma.gov.in/sites/default/files/PDF/Guidelines/CBDRR_Guidelines_Oct_2024.pdf)) [web:28]
